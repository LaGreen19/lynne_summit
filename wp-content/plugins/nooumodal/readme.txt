This allows you to insert a shortcode for a morphing modal window.

== Description ==
This plugin was created by our very own Ben with the base code from a tutorial over at CODYHOUSE written by Claudia Romano – credit where credit is due He has managed to take what Claudia published and turn it into a very neat shortcode based WordPress plugin, that’s mobile friendly.

== Installation ==
You can install the plugin the same way that you install any other WordPress plugin.  Navigate to Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin.
Once you have it all uploaded, the fun starts.
If you are using Elegant Themes Divi, then you have the page builder already built in.  Simply add rows, columns, then blocks to the page the way you normally would.  Once you have completed this, select a model that allows content (text, call to action etc) and you should see a button appear called “NoouModal”.

Click on the “NoouModal” button and a selector box will appear.  This allows you to amend the following:

    Button
        Colour
        Text Colour
        Text
    Modal
        Colour
        Text Colour

Once you have filled out the above, click “Add Morphing Modal” and the shortcode text will be placed into the content box for you.  All you then need to do is change the text “INSERT YOUR MODAL CONTENT HERE” and click save.
